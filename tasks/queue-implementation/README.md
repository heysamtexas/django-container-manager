# Django Container Manager Queue Implementation

This directory contains the complete implementation plan for adding queue management functionality to django-container-manager, based on the RFC from the community team.

## Overview

The queue implementation adds sophisticated job queuing capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility. Key features include:

- **Queue State Management**: Separate queue state from execution state
- **Priority-Based Processing**: Jobs processed by priority with FIFO fallback
- **Scheduled Execution**: Jobs can be scheduled for future execution
- **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
- **Concurrency Control**: Multi-worker safe with atomic job acquisition
- **Admin Integration**: Enhanced Django admin for queue management
- **Management Commands**: Command-line tools for queue processing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Foundation (3-4 days)
**Goal**: Add queue fields to ContainerJob with proper design

1. **[01-queue-model-fields.md](01-queue-model-fields.md)** - Add queue state fields to ContainerJob model
2. **[02-state-machine-validation.md](02-state-machine-validation.md)** - Implement state transition validation
3. **[03-database-migration.md](03-database-migration.md)** - Create migration with proper indexes

### Phase 2: Core Queue Service (4-5 days)
**Goal**: JobQueueManager with proper concurrency control

4. **[04-queue-manager-basic.md](04-queue-manager-basic.md)** - JobQueueManager class with basic operations
5. **[05-concurrency-control.md](05-concurrency-control.md)** - Atomic job acquisition with proper locking
6. **[06-retry-logic.md](06-retry-logic.md)** - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Phase 3: Management Commands (2-3 days)
**Goal**: Command-line interface for queue processing

7. **[07-queue-mode-command.md](07-queue-mode-command.md)** - Extend process_container_jobs with --queue-mode
8. **[08-graceful-shutdown.md](08-graceful-shutdown.md)** - Add signal handling and graceful shutdown

### Phase 4: Admin Integration (2 days)
**Goal**: Admin interface for queue management

9. **[09-admin-queue-display.md](09-admin-queue-display.md)** - Enhanced admin interface with queue status
10. **[10-admin-queue-actions.md](10-admin-queue-actions.md)** - Admin actions for queue management

### Phase 5: Testing (3-4 days)
**Goal**: Comprehensive test coverage

11. **[11-state-machine-tests.md](11-state-machine-tests.md)** - Test all state transitions and validation
12. **[12-concurrency-tests.md](12-concurrency-tests.md)** - Test multiple workers and race conditions
13. **[13-queue-operations-tests.md](13-queue-operations-tests.md)** - Test core queue functionality

### Phase 6: Documentation (1-2 days)
**Goal**: Complete documentation and examples

14. **[14-api-documentation.md](14-api-documentation.md)** - Update API docs for queue features
15. **[15-usage-examples.md](15-usage-examples.md)** - Create usage patterns and examples

## Key Architectural Decisions

Based on Guilfoyle's review, we've implemented these critical fixes:

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues from RFC
- **Priority Field**: Changed from CharField to IntegerField (0-100 scale)
- **Atomic Operations**: All state changes use database transactions with proper locking
- **State Machine**: Enforced valid transitions with comprehensive validation
- **Concurrency Safety**: `select_for_update(skip_locked=True)` for non-blocking acquisition
- **Error Classification**: Transient vs permanent errors with appropriate retry strategies
- **Proper Indexing**: Composite indexes for efficient queue queries

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights
- **Database-Centric**: Queue state stored in PostgreSQL for consistency
- **State Machine**: Prevents invalid job state transitions
- **Priority + FIFO**: High priority jobs first, FIFO within same priority
- **Retry Strategies**: Configurable retry behavior per job type
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean termination without job corruption
- **Resource Awareness**: Optional resource-based job launching limits

## Estimated Timeline

- **Total Implementation**: 15-18 days
- **Phase 1-3 (Core)**: 9-12 days
- **Phase 4-5 (Polish)**: 5-6 days  
- **Phase 6 (Docs)**: 1-2 days

## Dependencies

### Required
- Django 3.2+ (for database constraints)
- PostgreSQL recommended (for advanced locking features)
- Docker daemon access for job execution

### Optional
- Redis (for future distributed worker coordination)
- Prometheus (for metrics collection)

## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence:**
1. Start with Phase 1 tasks (database foundation)
2. Move to Phase 2 (core queue logic)
3. Implement Phase 3 (command-line tools)
4. Add Phase 4 (admin interface) 
5. Complete Phase 5 (testing)
6. Finish with Phase 6 (documentation)

**Parallel work opportunities:**
- Admin interface (Phase 4) can be developed alongside core queue service
- Documentation can be written as features are completed
- Tests can be written incrementally with each phase

## Getting Started

1. **Review the RFC**: Start with `../09_django-container-manager-queue-rfc.md`
2. **Begin Implementation**: Start with `01-queue-model-fields.md`
3. **Follow Dependencies**: Each task lists its dependencies
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Run tests after each phase
5. **Update Documentation**: Keep docs current as you implement

## Success Metrics

- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing code continues to work
- **Performance**: Queue operations complete within acceptable timeframes
- **Reliability**: Jobs don't get lost or duplicated under concurrent load
- **Usability**: Admin interface is intuitive for queue management
- **Documentation**: New users can successfully implement queue patterns

## Support

For implementation questions or architectural guidance:
- Review Guilfoyle's assessment in the original RFC discussion
- Each task file includes comprehensive implementation details
- Test files provide concrete examples of expected behavior
- Documentation files show real-world usage patterns
