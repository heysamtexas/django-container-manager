# Documentation Task: Installation Guide Creation

**Priority:** High
**Component:** User Documentation
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Current Status:** Missing - No installation documentation exists

## Task Summary
Create comprehensive INSTALL.md that covers all installation scenarios, from development setup to production deployment. Address the critical gap where users have no guidance on how to properly install and configure the system.

## Missing Installation Documentation
- No environment setup instructions
- No dependency management guidance
- No Docker configuration requirements
- No database setup procedures
- No production deployment guidance
- No troubleshooting for installation issues

## Specific Content Required

### 1. Prerequisites Section
- **System requirements**: OS compatibility, minimum versions
- **Required software**: 
  - Docker (minimum version, installation links)
  - Python 3.8+ (version management recommendations)
  - uv package manager (why uv, installation instructions)
  - Database (PostgreSQL/SQLite options and setup)
- **Optional but recommended**: 
  - Docker Compose for development
  - Redis for session management
  - Nginx for production

### 2. Development Installation
- **Step-by-step process**:
  ```bash
  # Clone repository
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd django-docker
  
  # Setup virtual environment with uv
  uv sync
  
  # Configure database
  uv run python manage.py migrate
  
  # Create superuser
  uv run python manage.py createsuperuser
  
  # Run development server
  uv run python manage.py runserver
  ```
- **Configuration files**: Settings explanation, environment variables
- **Docker setup**: Local Docker daemon configuration
- **Verification steps**: How to confirm everything works

### 3. Production Installation
- **Environment considerations**: Production vs development differences
- **Database setup**: PostgreSQL configuration, connection pooling
- **Docker daemon**: Production Docker configuration, security considerations
- **Web server**: Nginx/Apache configuration examples
- **Process management**: systemd, supervisor, or Docker Compose options
- **Security hardening**: Basic security measures for production

### 4. Docker Configuration
- **Local development**: Docker Desktop setup, permissions
- **Remote Docker**: Connecting to remote Docker daemons
- **Docker Compose**: Example compose files for development
- **Container networking**: Network configuration for job containers
- **Volume management**: Persistent storage considerations

### 5. Environment Variables
- **Required variables**: Database URL, Docker host, secret key
- **Optional variables**: Debug mode, logging levels, cache settings
- **Environment file**: .env file examples and location
- **Production secrets**: Secure secret management practices

### 6. Database Setup
- **SQLite (development)**: Default configuration, limitations
- **PostgreSQL (production)**: Installation, user creation, database setup
- **Migration process**: Initial migrations, handling migration conflicts
- **Backup considerations**: Database backup strategies

### 7. Installation Verification
- **System checks**: Django system checks to run
- **Test job execution**: Simple container job to verify Docker integration
- **Admin interface**: Accessing Django admin, creating first job
- **API endpoints**: Testing basic API functionality
- **Log collection**: Verifying log harvesting works

### 8. Common Installation Issues
- **Docker permission errors**: Docker daemon access, user groups
- **Database connection failures**: Connection string issues, firewall problems
- **Python dependency conflicts**: uv sync issues, virtual environment problems
- **Port conflicts**: Default port usage, changing port configuration
- **File permission issues**: Log directories, temporary files

## LLM Agent Guidelines

### Behavioral Constraints
- **DO**: Test every installation command on clean systems before documenting
- **DO**: Provide exact version numbers and compatibility matrices
- **DO**: Include rollback procedures for each installation step
- **DO**: Document all prerequisites clearly and completely
- **DO NOT**: Assume any software is pre-installed (except OS)
- **DO NOT**: Include commands that could damage existing systems
- **DO NOT**: Skip security considerations in production sections
- **LIMITS**: Each installation path should complete in under 30 minutes

### Security Requirements
- **Never include**: Real database credentials, API keys, or production URLs
- **Always emphasize**: Proper secret management and credential security
- **Validate all commands**: Ensure no commands run with unnecessary privileges
- **Production focus**: Highlight security implications of each configuration choice
- **Docker security**: Emphasize proper Docker daemon permissions and isolation

### Safe Operation Patterns
- **Command validation process**:
  1. Test each command on clean virtual machine
  2. Verify expected output matches documentation
  3. Test error scenarios and recovery procedures
  4. Document any system modifications made
- **Version verification**: Check software version compatibility before documenting
- **Rollback testing**: Ensure uninstall/rollback procedures actually work

### Error Handling
- **If commands fail**: Document the failure, don't skip or work around
- **If dependencies unavailable**: Provide alternative installation methods
- **If security risks identified**: Stop and request security review
- **When installation varies by platform**: Document all platform differences clearly

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] All installation commands tested on target platforms
- [ ] No privileged operations without explicit security warnings
- [ ] All configuration examples use placeholder values
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Security implications documented for production steps
- [ ] Docker daemon configuration verified safe and functional
- [ ] Database setup procedures tested with clean installations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Installation works on clean Ubuntu 22.04 system
- [ ] Installation works on clean macOS system
- [ ] Installation works on clean Windows system (if supported)
- [ ] Development setup completed in < 10 minutes
- [ ] Production guidance covers security basics
- [ ] All configuration options documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting section addresses 90% of common issues
- [ ] Docker integration fully explained

## File Location
- **Create**: `/Users/samtexas/src/playground/django-docker/INSTALL.md`
- **Reference**: CLAUDE.md for technical commands
- **Link from**: README.md quick start section
