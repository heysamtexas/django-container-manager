# Documentation Task: Model Docstring Enhancement

**Priority:** Medium
**Component:** Code Documentation
**Estimated Effort:** Medium
**Current Status:** Inconsistent model documentation in source code

## Task Summary
Enhance model docstrings in `container_manager/models.py` to provide comprehensive inline documentation. While the models are well-designed, their purpose, relationships, and usage patterns need clear documentation for developers working with the codebase.

## Current Documentation Gaps
- Inconsistent or missing model docstrings
- Unclear field purpose and validation rules
- Missing method documentation
- Absent property and computed field explanations
- No usage examples in docstrings
- Relationship patterns not explained

## Specific Improvements Needed

### 1. Model Class Docstrings
Each model needs comprehensive class-level documentation:

#### ContainerJob Model Enhancement
```python
class ContainerJob(models.Model):
    """
    Represents a containerized job execution request with full lifecycle tracking.
    
    This is the core model for managing Docker container jobs. It handles the complete
    lifecycle from job creation through execution to completion, including resource
    monitoring, log collection, and status tracking.
    
    Key Features:
    - Multi-executor support (Docker, Cloud Run, Mock)
    - Resource limit enforcement (memory, CPU)
    - Environment variable template integration
    - Automatic log harvesting and storage
    - Comprehensive status tracking and transitions
    
    Typical Usage:
        # Create and execute a simple job
        job = ContainerJob.objects.create(
            image='python:3.9',
            command='python -c "print(\'Hello World\')"',
            docker_host=ExecutorHost.objects.get(name='production')
        )
        job.launch()
        
        # Monitor until completion
        while not job.is_terminal_status:
            time.sleep(5)
            job.refresh_from_db()
        
        # Retrieve results
        logs = job.get_logs()
        exit_code = job.exit_code
    
    Status Lifecycle:
        pending -> starting -> running -> completed/failed
        
    Related Models:
        - ExecutorHost: Defines where the job executes
        - EnvironmentVariableTemplate: Provides environment configuration
        - ContainerExecution: Tracks individual execution attempts
    """
```

#### ExecutorHost Model Enhancement
```python
class ExecutorHost(models.Model):
    """
    Represents an execution environment for containerized jobs.
    
    ExecutorHost defines where and how jobs are executed. It abstracts different
    execution backends (Docker daemons, Cloud Run, etc.) behind a unified interface
    while maintaining specific configuration for each executor type.
    
    Supported Executor Types:
    - 'docker': Local or remote Docker daemon execution
    - 'cloudrun': Google Cloud Run serverless execution
    - 'mock': Testing and development mock executor
    
    Connection String Formats:
        Docker:
        - unix:///var/run/docker.sock (local Unix socket)
        - tcp://docker.example.com:2376 (remote TCP)
        - tcp://docker.example.com:2376 (secure TCP with TLS)
        
        Cloud Run:
        - projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/REGION (GCP project and region)
        
        Mock:
        - mock://localhost (testing configuration)
    
    Health Monitoring:
        Hosts are automatically health-checked to ensure availability.
        Inactive hosts are excluded from job scheduling.
    
    Example Usage:
        # Create Docker host
        docker_host = ExecutorHost.objects.create(
            name='production-docker',
            executor_type='docker',
            connection_string='unix:///var/run/docker.sock',
            is_active=True
        )
        
        # Verify connectivity
        if docker_host.health_check():
            print(f"Host {docker_host.name} is available")
        
        # Use in job creation
        job = ContainerJob.objects.create(
            image='nginx:latest',
            command='nginx -g "daemon off;"',
            docker_host=docker_host
        )
    """
```

#### EnvironmentVariableTemplate Model Enhancement
```python
class EnvironmentVariableTemplate(models.Model):
    """
    Template for reusable environment variable configurations across jobs.
    
    Provides a way to define and reuse common environment variable sets,
    promoting consistency and reducing duplication in job configurations.
    Supports standard KEY=VALUE format with validation and parsing.
    
    Format Requirements:
    - One variable per line: KEY=VALUE
    - No spaces around equals sign: KEY=VALUE (not KEY = VALUE)
    - Quotes for values with spaces: KEY="value with spaces"
    - Comments not supported in variable text
    - Empty lines are ignored
    
    Variable Resolution:
        Templates are resolved at job execution time, allowing for
        dynamic value injection and validation.
    
    Example Usage:
        # Create environment template
        env_template = EnvironmentVariableTemplate.objects.create(
            name='python-production',
            description='Production Python application environment',
            environment_variables_text='''
PYTHONPATH=/app
ENV=production
DEBUG=False
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/app
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
            '''.strip()
        )
        
        # Use in job
        job = ContainerJob.objects.create(
            image='myapp:latest',
            command='python manage.py runserver',
            docker_host=docker_host,
            environment_template=env_template
        )
        
        # Verify parsed variables
        env_dict = env_template.get_environment_variables_dict()
        assert env_dict['ENV'] == 'production'
        assert env_dict['DEBUG'] == 'False'
    
    Security Considerations:
        - Avoid storing secrets directly in templates
        - Use external secret management for sensitive values
        - Template content is stored in plaintext in database
    """
```

#### ContainerExecution Model Enhancement
```python
class ContainerExecution(models.Model):
    """
    Tracks individual execution attempts for a ContainerJob.
    
    While ContainerJob represents the job request and overall status,
    ContainerExecution tracks the details of individual execution attempts.
    This separation allows for job retry logic and detailed execution history.
    
    Execution Lifecycle:
        1. ContainerExecution created when job starts
        2. Container ID recorded when container launches
        3. Logs collected during execution
        4. Final status and timing recorded on completion
    
    Relationship to ContainerJob:
        - One-to-many: A job can have multiple execution attempts
        - Cascade delete: Executions are deleted when job is deleted
        - Status synchronization: Execution status updates job status
    
    Log Management:
        Container logs are automatically collected and stored in the
        logs field. Large logs may be truncated or stored externally
        depending on configuration.
    
    Example Usage:
        # Access execution details
        job = ContainerJob.objects.get(id=job_id)
        
        # Get latest execution attempt
        latest_execution = job.containerexecution_set.latest('started_at')
        
        # Access container details
        container_id = latest_execution.container_id
        execution_logs = latest_execution.logs
        
        # Analyze execution history
        for execution in job.containerexecution_set.all():
            duration = execution.finished_at - execution.started_at
            print(f"Attempt {execution.id}: {duration} seconds")
    """
```

### 2. Field Documentation Enhancement
Add comprehensive field docstrings explaining:

#### ContainerJob Fields
```python
class ContainerJob(models.Model):
    image = models.CharField(
        max_length=255,
        help_text=(
            "Docker image specification in standard format. "
            "Examples: 'python:3.9', 'nginx:latest', 'myregistry.com/myapp:v1.2.3'. "
            "Image will be pulled if not available locally."
        )
    )
    
    command = models.TextField(
        help_text=(
            "Command to execute inside the container. Can be shell form "
            "('sh -c \"echo hello\"') or exec form ('[\"echo\", \"hello\"]'). "
            "Shell form is recommended for simple commands."
        )
    )
    
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=[
            ('pending', 'Pending'),
            ('starting', 'Starting'),
            ('running', 'Running'),
            ('completed', 'Completed'),
            ('failed', 'Failed'),
            ('cancelled', 'Cancelled'),
        ],
        default='pending',
        help_text=(
            "Current job status. Transitions: pending -> starting -> running -> "
            "completed/failed/cancelled. Terminal statuses: completed, failed, cancelled."
        )
    )
    
    memory_limit = models.IntegerField(
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        help_text=(
            "Memory limit in megabytes (MB). Container will be killed if it "
            "exceeds this limit. Leave blank for no memory limit."
        )
    )
    
    cpu_limit = models.FloatField(
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        help_text=(
            "CPU limit as number of CPU cores (e.g., 1.0 = 1 core, 0.5 = half core). "
            "Container CPU usage will be throttled to this limit."
        )
    )
```

### 3. Method Documentation Enhancement
Document all custom methods with comprehensive docstrings:

```python
def launch(self):
    """
    Initiate job execution on the configured executor host.
    
    This method starts the job execution process by:
    1. Validating job configuration and host availability
    2. Creating a ContainerExecution record
    3. Delegating to the appropriate executor for container launch
    4. Updating job status to 'starting'
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if job launch initiated successfully, False otherwise
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If job configuration is invalid
        ExecutorError: If executor host is unavailable or fails
        
    Example:
        job = ContainerJob.objects.create(
            image='python:3.9',
            command='python -c "print(\'Hello\')"',
            docker_host=docker_host
        )
        
        if job.launch():
            print(f"Job {job.id} launched successfully")
        else:
            print(f"Job {job.id} failed to launch")
    """

def get_logs(self):
    """
    Retrieve container logs for this job.
    
    Aggregates logs from all execution attempts, with the most recent
    execution's logs appearing last. For active jobs, may include
    partial logs from the current execution.
    
    Returns:
        str: Combined container logs from all execution attempts
        
    Note:
        For large log files, content may be truncated. Use harvest()
        to ensure complete log collection before calling this method.
        
    Example:
        job = ContainerJob.objects.get(id=job_id)
        logs = job.get_logs()
        
        # Parse logs for specific information
        if 'ERROR' in logs:
            print("Job encountered errors")
        
        # Save logs to file
        with open(f'job_{job.id}_logs.txt', 'w') as f:
            f.write(logs)
    """

def harvest(self):
    """
    Collect final job results and update status to terminal state.
    
    This method finalizes job execution by:
    1. Collecting complete container logs
    2. Recording final exit code
    3. Updating timestamps (finished_at)
    4. Setting terminal status (completed/failed)
    5. Cleaning up temporary resources
    
    Should be called after job execution completes to ensure
    all results are captured and stored.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if harvest completed successfully
        
    Side Effects:
        - Updates job status to terminal state
        - Records final execution metrics
        - May trigger cleanup of container resources
        
    Example:
        # Monitor job until completion
        while job.status in ['pending', 'starting', 'running']:
            time.sleep(5)
            job.refresh_from_db()
        
        # Harvest final results
        job.harvest()
        
        # Now safe to access final results
        print(f"Exit code: {job.exit_code}")
        print(f"Runtime: {job.runtime_duration}")
    """
```

### 4. Property Documentation Enhancement
Document computed properties and their behavior:

```python
@property
def is_terminal_status(self):
    """
    Check if job has reached a terminal status.
    
    Terminal statuses are final states that indicate job execution
    has completed and will not continue. Non-terminal statuses
    indicate the job is still active or queued.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if job status is terminal (completed, failed, cancelled)
        
    Terminal Statuses:
        - completed: Job finished successfully (exit code 0)
        - failed: Job finished with error (non-zero exit code)
        - cancelled: Job was manually cancelled before completion
        
    Non-Terminal Statuses:
        - pending: Job queued for execution
        - starting: Job initialization in progress
        - running: Job actively executing
        
    Example:
        # Wait for job completion
        while not job.is_terminal_status:
            print(f"Job status: {job.status}")
            time.sleep(5)
            job.refresh_from_db()
        
        print(f"Job finished with status: {job.status}")
    """

@property 
def runtime_duration(self):
    """
    Calculate job execution duration.
    
    For completed jobs, returns the time between started_at and finished_at.
    For active jobs, returns time elapsed since started_at.
    For pending jobs, returns None.
    
    Returns:
        timedelta or None: Job execution duration, or None if not started
        
    Example:
        job = ContainerJob.objects.get(id=job_id)
        
        if job.runtime_duration:
            duration = job.runtime_duration
            print(f"Job ran for {duration.total_seconds()} seconds")
            
            # Format for display
            hours, remainder = divmod(duration.total_seconds(), 3600)
            minutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)
            print(f"Duration: {int(hours):02d}:{int(minutes):02d}:{int(seconds):02d}")
        else:
            print("Job has not started yet")
    """
```

### 5. Manager and QuerySet Documentation
Document custom managers and their methods:

```python
class ContainerJobManager(models.Manager):
    """
    Custom manager for ContainerJob with common query patterns.
    
    Provides convenient methods for filtering jobs by status, timing,
    and execution characteristics. All methods return QuerySets that
    can be further filtered or chained.
    """
    
    def pending(self):
        """
        Get jobs waiting for execution.
        
        Returns:
            QuerySet: Jobs with status 'pending'
            
        Example:
            # Get count of pending jobs
            pending_count = ContainerJob.objects.pending().count()
            
            # Process pending jobs
            for job in ContainerJob.objects.pending()[:10]:
                job.launch()
        """
        return self.filter(status='pending')
    
    def active(self):
        """
        Get jobs currently executing or starting.
        
        Returns:
            QuerySet: Jobs with status 'starting' or 'running'
            
        Example:
            # Monitor active jobs
            active_jobs = ContainerJob.objects.active()
            print(f"{active_jobs.count()} jobs currently active")
            
            # Check resource usage
            total_memory = sum(job.memory_limit or 0 for job in active_jobs)
            print(f"Total memory allocated: {total_memory}MB")
        """
        return self.filter(status__in=['starting', 'running'])
```

## LLM Agent Guidelines

### Behavioral Constraints
- **DO**: Document only existing functionality, never add new features
- **DO**: Test all code examples in docstrings before documenting
- **DO**: Use consistent docstring format throughout all models
- **DO**: Focus on documenting business logic and relationships
- **DO NOT**: Modify model code structure or add new methods
- **DO NOT**: Document internal implementation details not relevant to users
- **DO NOT**: Change existing method signatures or behaviors
- **DO NOT**: Add docstrings that contradict actual code behavior
- **LIMITS**: Documentation-only changes, no functional modifications

### Security Requirements
- **Code integrity**: Never modify model behavior during documentation
- **Data protection**: Don't include sensitive data in docstring examples
- **Access patterns**: Document proper data access methods, not implementation details
- **Validation rules**: Accurately document field validation without exposing internals

### Safe Operation Patterns
- **Documentation workflow**:
  1. Read and understand existing model code thoroughly
  2. Identify all public methods, properties, and fields
  3. Create comprehensive docstrings for each component
  4. Test all code examples in clean environment
  5. Verify docstrings accurately reflect actual behavior
- **Code example validation**:
  1. Create isolated test environment
  2. Run all docstring examples exactly as written
  3. Verify expected behavior matches documentation
  4. Update examples if behavior differs from documentation

### Error Handling
- **If code behavior unclear**: Research implementation, don't guess behavior
- **If examples don't work**: Fix examples to match actual behavior, don't modify code
- **If conflicting implementations found**: Document current behavior, note any inconsistencies
- **If unsure about model relationships**: Study database schema and actual usage patterns

### Code Documentation Safety Boundaries
- **NEVER modify**: Model field definitions, method implementations, or class structure
- **NEVER add**: New methods, properties, or functionality during documentation
- **NEVER change**: Existing validation rules or business logic
- **NEVER include**: Sensitive production data in examples
- **NEVER document**: Private methods or internal implementation details
