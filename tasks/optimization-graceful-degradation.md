# Graceful Degradation and Circuit Breaker

**Priority**: Low  
**Category**: Resilience/Reliability  
**Greybeard Score Impact**: +0.5 points  

## Problem Statement

Currently, when Docker daemon becomes overloaded or unavailable, the system doesn't degrade gracefully. All operations will fail simultaneously without circuit breaking or backoff strategies.

## Current Behavior

- Docker daemon overload → All job launches fail
- Network issues → All status checks timeout  
- Host unavailability → No automatic failover
- No backoff on repeated failures

## Proposed Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Implementation Approach
```python
class DockerCircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = 'CLOSED'  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    
    def call(self, operation):
        if self.state == 'OPEN':
            if self._should_attempt_reset():
                self.state = 'HALF_OPEN'
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError()
        
        try:
            result = operation()
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()
            raise
```

### Graceful Degradation Strategies

1. **Queue Jobs When Docker Unavailable**
   - Keep jobs in "pending" state
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Alert operators to issues

2. **Skip Non-Critical Operations**
   - Defer log collection if Docker slow
   - Reduce status check frequency
   - Prioritize job launches over monitoring

3. **Failover to Alternative Hosts**
   - Route jobs to healthy Docker hosts
   - Mark unhealthy hosts as temporarily unavailable
   - Automatic recovery when hosts return

## Specific Features

### Circuit Breaker for Docker Operations
- Track failure rates per Docker host
- Open circuit after threshold failures
- Half-open for testing recovery
- Exponential backoff on repeated failures

### Health Check Integration
```python
def check_docker_host_health(host):
    try:
        client = get_docker_client(host)
        client.ping()  # Quick health check
        return True
    except Exception:
        return False
```

### Graceful Job Queuing
- Queue jobs when all hosts unhealthy
- Process queue when hosts recover
- Configurable queue size limits

## When to Implement

- After experiencing Docker daemon overload in production
- When running multiple Docker hosts
- Before scaling to high job volumes
- When uptime requirements increase

## Success Criteria

- System remains partially functional during Docker issues
- No cascade failures when one host goes down
- Automatic recovery when issues resolve
- Clear visibility into circuit breaker state

## Configuration Options

```python
CONTAINER_MANAGER = {
    'CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED': True,
    'CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD': 5,
    'CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT': 60,
    'GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION_ENABLED': True,
    'MAX_QUEUED_JOBS': 1000,
}
```

## Notes from Greybeard

> "Graceful degradation (0.5 points) - What happens when Docker daemon is overloaded?"

This becomes important when you have multiple Docker hosts or high job volumes. The current system will work fine until you hit resource limits, then everything fails at once. Circuit breakers prevent that cascade failure scenario.

## Implementation Priority

Implement after:
1. Production deployment is stable
2. Multiple Docker hosts are in use  
3. Job volumes increase significantly
4. Uptime requirements become critical

This is resilience engineering - valuable for mature systems but not required for initial production deployment.
