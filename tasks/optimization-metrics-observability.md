# Metrics and Observability Enhancement

**Priority**: Low  
**Category**: Operations/Monitoring  
**Greybeard Score Impact**: +0.5 points  

## Problem Statement

While basic logging is comprehensive, there's no metrics collection for operational monitoring. This makes it harder to understand system performance and identify issues proactively.

## Current State

- ✅ Good structured logging with job IDs and execution IDs
- ✅ Error logging for all failure scenarios  
- ❌ No performance metrics collection
- ❌ No operational dashboards
- ❌ No alerting on key thresholds

## Proposed Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- Job launch latency (time from pending to running)
- Container creation time
- Batch status check performance (jobs per second)
- Docker API response times

### Operational Metrics  
- Jobs by status (pending, running, completed, failed)
- Container resource usage (memory, CPU)
- Error rates by error type
- Queue depth and processing rate

### Business Metrics
- Job success/failure rates
- Average job duration
- Peak concurrent jobs
- Host utilization

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Django Metrics
```python
from django.core.cache import cache
import time

def track_job_launch_time(job_id, start_time):
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    cache.set(f"metrics:job_launch:{job_id}", duration, 3600)
```

### Option 2: Prometheus Integration
```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

job_launches = Counter('container_job_launches_total', 'Total job launches')
job_duration = Histogram('container_job_duration_seconds', 'Job duration')
active_jobs = Gauge('container_active_jobs', 'Currently active jobs')
```

### Option 3: Django Admin Metrics Page
Simple metrics display in Django admin for basic monitoring.

## When to Implement

- After production deployment stabilizes  
- When operational questions arise about system performance
- Before scaling to higher job volumes

## Success Criteria

- Visibility into system performance trends
- Ability to set meaningful alerts
- Data-driven optimization decisions

## Notes from Greybeard

> "Metrics/observability (0.5 points) - Basic logging is there, but no metrics"

The current logging is sufficient for debugging. Metrics become valuable when you need to understand performance trends and set up proactive monitoring.
