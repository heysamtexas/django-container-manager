# Coverage Task: WSGI and Main Entry Points

**Priority:** Low
**Django Component:** Application Entry Points
**Estimated Effort:** Small
**Current Coverage:** 0% (0/6 statements covered)

## Coverage Gap Summary
- Current coverage: 0%
- Target coverage: 50% (non-critical infrastructure)
- Missing lines: wsgi.py (10-16), main.py (1-2)
- Critical impact: Low - entry point files typically not tested extensively

## Uncovered Code Analysis
The WSGI and main entry point files are currently untested. These files are:

### WSGI Configuration (django_docker_manager/wsgi.py)
- Django WSGI application setup
- Environment configuration
- Application object creation

### Main Entry Point (main.py)
- Simple entry point script
- Basic application initialization

## Suggested Tests

### Test 1: WSGI Application Configuration
- **Purpose:** Verify WSGI application can be created successfully
- **Django-specific considerations:** Settings loading, WSGI compliance
- **Test outline:**
  ```python
  import os
  import unittest
  from unittest.mock import patch
  
  class WSGITest(unittest.TestCase):
      
      def test_wsgi_application_creation(self):
          # Test that WSGI application can be imported and created
          with patch.dict(os.environ, {'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE': 'django_docker_manager.settings'}):
              try:
                  from django_docker_manager.wsgi import application
                  self.assertIsNotNone(application)
                  # Verify it's a WSGI application
                  self.assertTrue(callable(application))
              except ImportError as e:
                  self.fail(f"Failed to import WSGI application: {e}")

      def test_wsgi_settings_module_set(self):
          # Test that Django settings module is properly configured
          with patch.dict(os.environ, {'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE': 'django_docker_manager.settings'}):
              from django_docker_manager import wsgi
              import django
              from django.conf import settings
              
              # Should be able to access settings without error
              self.assertIsNotNone(settings.SECRET_KEY)
  ```

### Test 2: Main Entry Point
- **Purpose:** Test main.py entry point functionality
- **Django-specific considerations:** Basic import and execution
- **Test outline:**
  ```python
  def test_main_module_importable(self):
      # Test that main module can be imported without errors
      try:
          import main
          # If it imports successfully, that's the main requirement
          self.assertTrue(True)
      except ImportError as e:
          self.fail(f"Failed to import main module: {e}")
      except Exception as e:
          # Other exceptions might be expected depending on main.py content
          # Check if it's a reasonable execution error vs import error
          self.assertNotIsInstance(e, ImportError)
  ```

## Django Testing Patterns
- **Entry Point Testing:** Basic import and creation tests
- **Settings Integration:** Verify proper Django settings loading
- **WSGI Compliance:** Basic WSGI application validation
- **Environment Handling:** Test environment variable handling

## Definition of Done
- [ ] WSGI application creation tested
- [ ] Main module import tested
- [ ] Settings loading verified
- [ ] Coverage target of 50% achieved (reasonable for entry points)
- [ ] Django testing best practices followed

## Notes
- Entry point files typically have low test coverage by design
- Focus on ensuring they can be imported and created without errors
- WSGI testing is mainly about configuration validation
- Main.py testing depends on actual content (currently minimal)
