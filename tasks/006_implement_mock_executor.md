# Task 006: Implement Mock Executor for Testing

## Objective
Create a MockExecutor that simulates container execution in-memory, enabling comprehensive testing of the multi-executor system without requiring external dependencies or real container execution.

## Git Strategy  
- Branch: `task-006-mock-executor`
- Commit pattern: "Add [component]: [functionality]"
- Commits: "Add MockExecutor class", "Add configurable simulation behaviors", "Add comprehensive tests"

## Prerequisites
- Task 001 completed (ContainerExecutor interface)
- Task 004 completed (ExecutorFactory)
- Understanding of testing patterns

## Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Create `container_manager/executors/mock.py`
2. [ ] Implement MockExecutor with configurable behaviors
3. [ ] Add simulation of different execution scenarios
4. [ ] Create comprehensive test suite using MockExecutor
5. [ ] Add performance benchmarking capabilities
6. [ ] Document mock configuration options
7. [ ] Run ruff format and check before committing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] MockExecutor implements all ContainerExecutor methods
- [ ] Configurable simulation of success/failure scenarios
- [ ] Deterministic behavior for testing
- [ ] Performance testing capabilities
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Documentation for mock configuration

## Next Task Preparation
Enables testing of all subsequent executor implementations
