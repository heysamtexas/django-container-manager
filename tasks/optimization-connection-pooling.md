# Docker Connection Pooling Optimization

**Priority**: Low  
**Category**: Performance Optimization  
**Greybeard Score Impact**: +0.5 points  

## Problem Statement

Currently, the Docker executor creates new Docker clients on every operation. While not a production killer, this could lead to connection pool exhaustion under very high load scenarios.

## Current Implementation

```python
def _get_client(self, docker_host: ExecutorHost) -> docker.DockerClient:
    # Creates new client each time or uses basic caching
    if host_key not in self._clients:
        self._clients[host_key] = docker.DockerClient(...)
```

## Proposed Solution

Implement proper connection pooling with:
- Connection lifecycle management
- Pool size limits
- Connection health checking
- Automatic reconnection on failures

## Implementation Approach

```python
class DockerConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self, max_connections=10):
        self._pool = {}
        self._max_connections = max_connections
        
    def get_client(self, host):
        # Implement proper pooling logic
        pass
```

## When to Implement

- After production deployment
- When monitoring shows connection exhaustion
- During first optimization sprint

## Success Metrics

- Reduced Docker client creation overhead
- Better connection utilization under load
- No connection pool exhaustion errors

## Notes from Greybeard

> "Connection pooling (0.5 points) - You correctly decided to defer this"

This is an optimization, not a production blocker. Ship first, optimize based on real usage patterns.
